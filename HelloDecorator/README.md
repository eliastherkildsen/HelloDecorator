The Decorator Pattern implemented in C #. <br/>
In this exercise, you will implement a full running version of the coffee-shop-simulator from the Notes Head <br/>
First. This will be a console application <br/>
Learning goal: Use the programming language C# to realize design patterns.<br/>
Apply the decorator in a C# console application.<br/>

    1. Create these concrete categories of base products: <br/>
    HouseBlend (1.2 Euro) DarkRoast (1.1 Euro) and Decaf (1.4 Euro).

    2. In addition, you must make it possible to get these condiments like these: <br/>
    Whip (0.1 Euro), Milk (0.15 Euro) and Sugar (0.2 Euro) – this is done with the decorator part!

    3. Explain the principle of Open-Closed, <br/>
    a) Give an example of being open for extensions (with code) <br/>
    b) Give an example of this design being closed for changes – what cannot be changed?

    4. Make a demo where you construct different objects with several condiments. Prove that the<br/>
    computation of total prices works correctly!
